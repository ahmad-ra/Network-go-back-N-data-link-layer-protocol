# Network-go-back-N-data-link-layer-protocol
Simulation of Network data link layer (refer to OSI ref model) protocol called go back N

#Real time results

The heuristic and undeterministic nature of network communication is perfectly simulated by using separate threads for each simulated entity.
with simulating the physical propagation delay using a thread with adjustable parameters that simulates a long tube between transmitter and 
reciever.

Due to the nature of threads competing to get the CPU resources to run , the protocol is perfectly simulating real life with different results
occuring on each run because of different circumstances that occur to the threads causing them to show the real errors that might occur
in this protocol
